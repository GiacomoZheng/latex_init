  title         = {K-polystability of Q-Fano varieties admitting K{\"a}hler-Einstein metrics},
  abstract      = {It is shown that any, possibly singular, Fano variety X admitting a K{\"a}hler-Einstein metric is K-polystable, thus confirming one direction of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture in the setting of {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}Q{\}}{\$}{\$}-Fano varieties equipped with their anti-canonical polarization. The proof is based on a new formula expressing the Donaldson-Futaki invariants in terms of the slope of the Ding functional along a geodesic ray in the space of all bounded positively curved metrics on the anti-canonical line bundle of X. One consequence is that a toric Fano variety X is K-polystable iff it is K-polystable along toric degenerations iff 0 is the barycenter of the canonical weight polytope P associated to X. The results also extend to the logarithmic setting and in particular to the setting of K{\"a}hler-Einstein metrics with edge-cone singularities. Applications to geodesic stability, bounds on the Ricci potential and Perelman's {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}lambda {\$}{\$}-entropy functional on K-unstable Fano manifolds are also given.},

  abstract = {Let X be a normal complex projective variety with at worst klt singularities, and L a big line bundle on X. We use valuations to study the log canonical threshold of L, as well as another invariant, the stability threshold. The latter generalizes a notion by Fujita and Odaka, and can be used to characterize when a Q-Fano variety is K-semistable or uniformly K-stable. It can also be used to generalize volume bounds due to Fujita and Liu. The two thresholds can be written as infima of certain functionals on the space of valuations on X. When L is ample, we prove that these infima are attained. In the toric case, toric valuations achieve these infima, and we obtain simple expressions for the two thresholds in terms of the moment polytope of L.},
